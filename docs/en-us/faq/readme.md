The Authentication service is responsible for authenticating and identifying the systemic user of the B2B Middleware.
Obtaining the token through the Authentication service is mandatory at the beginning of each B2B Middleware session, and a token generated for a travel agent must be used until the end of that same agent's session.
The token will expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. After this time, it will be necessary to request a new token, otherwise the methods called will return the HTTP status 401: Unauthorized.

Answer: Just perform a Delete logout in the users API.


## 20. What are the differences between Primary Key and Secondary Key (We are using only Primary Key in Postman)
Answer: There is no difference between the functionality of the primary and secondary key, both are created solely for security reasons, and if it is necessary to block one, the other can be used automatically. In fact, the security team suggests updating the subscription Keys used every six months.
