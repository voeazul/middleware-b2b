# Documentation of APIs and Reservation Flow

Welcome to the Middleware APIs centralized documentation and reservation flow guide! Here you will find information about the available APIs and how to perform reservation, change and other main flows.

## Security

Due to security validation, to complement the API access, it will be necessary to send a header User-Agent, with the value salesb2b/agency_name in addition to the subscription key header in STG and PRD environment. Example: - salesb2b/xpto_travels.
