# Technical validation

We suggest carrying out the following steps for the development validation. Remembering that the necessary scenarios may vary according to the methods developed.

1. Formalize by email .suporteb2b@voeazul.com.br which methods were developed and will be implemented.
2. The validated scenarios must be added to the Excel .xls file referencing the Booking number, if in your scenarios contain the booking creation process.
3. The tests must be executed in stg environment.
4. You must send a .har document with each tested flow and bookings numbers.

# Go live plan

1. Check the best agenda for the go live, if possible, avoid Fridays and weekends to have all the team available in case of any problem.
2. Production subscription key process, you need to do the same process that was done in stg environment, ask for the subscription key in the developer portal 2 days in advance to the go live date.
3.  If possible, you could do some tests in the production environment to validate the new sub key before starting the go live.
4. Once validated the steps 2 and 3 we can plan the go live.
5. After go live, any abnormal behavior, register an issue on Github for analysis.
6. We will have a hyppercare process together with IT team, weâ€™ll check if everything is working fine.
7.  After the hypercare, the IT support process will begin, where problems, suggestions and improvements must be opened on GitHub for analysis.
