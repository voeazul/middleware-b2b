# API Response Time

In this section, we present the expected response time benchmark and the limit variation for the main Middleware APIs, both in the approval environment and in the production environment. This information is useful for understanding the expected performance of APIs and ensuring a better experience for users.

## Approval Environment

The following table shows the expected response time benchmark and limit variation for the main APIs in the approval environment:

| API | Expected Response Time (ms) | Limit Variation (ms) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `authentication/api/v1/token` | ? | ? |
| `user/api/v1/authenticate` | ? | ? |
| `shopping/api/v1/airsearch` | ? | ? |
| `order/api/v1/order` | ? | ? |
| `order/api/v1/checkout` | ? | ? |
| `order/payments/api/v1/payments` | ? | ? |

## Production Environment

The following table shows the expected response time benchmark and threshold range for the main APIs in the production environment:

| API | Expected Response Time (ms) | Limit Variation (ms) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `authentication/api/v1/token` | ? | ? |
| `user/api/v1/authenticate` | ? | ? |
| `shopping/api/v1/airsearch` | ? | ? |
| `order/api/v1/order` | ? | ? |
| `order/api/v1/checkout` | ? | ? |
| `order/payments/api/v1/payments` | ? | ? |

This information is provided as an approximate reference and may vary depending on factors such as unexpected load increases, network connectivity and other external influences. We maintain regular monitoring of performance in order to take action when necessary.
